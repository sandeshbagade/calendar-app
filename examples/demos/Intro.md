Once you've configured a localizer, the Calendar is ready to accept `dateFormat` props. These props determine
how dates will be displayed throughout the component and are specific to the localizer of your choice. For
instance if you are using the Moment localizer,
then any [Moment format pattern](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) is valid!
